'''''WiFiz (A NetCTL GUI Frontend)'''''

WiFiz is a brand new NetCTL frontend. The reason why it uses NetCTL as a 
backend, is due to the fact that it better integrates with systemd, 
Arch Linux's new(ish) init scripts.

WiFiz is still alpha based software, It depends on wxpython, wireless-tools, 
and obviouily netctl and probable a few others as well.
