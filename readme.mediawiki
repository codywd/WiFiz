'''''WiFiz (A NetCTL GUI Frontend)'''''

WiFiz is a brand new NetCTL frontend. The reason why it uses NetCTL as a 
backend, is due to the fact that it better integrates with systemd, 
Arch Linux's new(ish) init scripts.

WiFiz is currently in alpha state, and as such, the program is in a very volatile state. Anything can be changed. Trust nothing!

WiFiz depends on python2, wxpython, 
wireless-tools, and obviouily netctl. (And maybe a few others as well.)
