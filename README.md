# WiFiz v0.9.1.1


## About WiFiz
WiFiz is a brand new GUI NetCTL frontend. The reason why it uses NetCTL 
as a 
backend over NetCFG, is due to the fact that it better integrates with 
systemd, 
Arch Linux's new(ish) init scripts.

## General Notes
WiFiz is in beta state, and generally considered stable for daily use. While things may break (and they have! Just look at issue #8!) they will be fixed as soon as possible.

## Dependencies
1. python2
2. wxpython
3. wireless-tools
4. wpa_supplicant
5. netctl
Those are currently all the dependencies I know of.
